  abstract  = {Every day, many people use at least one social network (or social media) account. This development has been boosted by the rapid growth of technology, making both smartphones and mobile data much more accessible and inexpensive. Therefore, the number of social networks users is growing rapidly, accounting more than 1 billion active users world-wide. The ease of use, as well as the ability to communicate without spatial and temporal restrictions underpinned the rapid increase of the popularity of social networks, as well as their wide acceptance by the general public. This popularity influences people's opinion on many issues, shapes consumer habits and behaviour, mood, etc. The work of many scientists across multiple disciplines has focused on studying social media from various perspectives, including marketing, journal-ism and sociology. This paper investigates how trending in-formation from social media can be used to match topics of interest from cultural database indices. Matches identified in this process are then presented to cultural venue curators, who can then review matches, mark them as useful or reject them, and exploit them for various tasks, and most notably for the promotion of the venue and its content. More specifically, we have developed an application, which collects the 10 most popular twitter trends and then matches their content with the contents of a given cultural database. Using the results of this match, items from the database that may be related to current issues may be recommended to the user. As a result, these matches, after being inspected and approved by the administrator, can be used to attract the interest of the target audience, highlighting the correlation of current issues with the database’s items.},
