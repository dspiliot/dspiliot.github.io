abstract="This work explores the use of speech enabled complex graphs that are designed to enable non-technical users to edit and appraise visually complex semantic structures. The standard usability evaluation that was performed previously employed young, computer-literate participants that were familiar with such concepts and tools. We report on the findings of how technically-savvy and technically challenged users experience the different modalities, make choices and identify each modality advantages and shortcomings as well as the ability of each user group to optimally exploit modality combination paths.",
