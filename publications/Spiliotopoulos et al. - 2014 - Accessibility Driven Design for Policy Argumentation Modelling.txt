abstract="This paper discusses the design of a web interface for policy argumentation modeling. Given the complexity of the interface the WAI-ARIA descriptions were used to ensure that the data were accessible and the visual-heavy presentation was simplified. Conclusions were drawn as to the usefulness of the WAI-ARIA guidelines to an elaborate design of user interaction with highly dynamic content.",
