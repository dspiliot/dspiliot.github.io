abstract="Harvesting the web and social web data is a meticulous and complex task. Applying the results to a successful business case such as brand monitoring requires high precision and recall for the opinion mining and entity recognition tasks. This work reports on the integrated platform of a state of the art Named-entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) system and opinion mining methods for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approach on a fully automatic service for brand monitoring for the Greek language. The service has been successfully deployed to the biggest search engine in Greece powering the large-scale linguistic and sentiment analysis of about 80.000 resources per hour.",
